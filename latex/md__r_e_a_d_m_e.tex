{\bfseries{CSCE 412 Cloud Computing Project 2}} -\/ Creating a Load Balancer

Learn how to model a simulation of a large company\textquotesingle{}s load-\/balancing web requests using a load balancer.

This project will require a real-\/world implementation of a queue. Thsi will also need a struct, a lower-\/level data structure that allows data to be contained in an object.

Load balancers are available commercially, but in this project, you will build one that has\+:

‚óè {\bfseries{Requests}} -\/ generates random IP addresses, both in and out, and random times for each request to be processed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item IP in
\item IP out
\item Time (integer) ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

‚óè {\bfseries{Webserver(s)}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Takes requests from the Load Balancer
\item Process the requests
\item Asks for another
\end{DoxyItemize}

‚óè {\bfseries{Load Balancer}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Queue of requests
\item Keeps track of time.
