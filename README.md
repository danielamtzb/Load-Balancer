# Load-Balancer üñ•Ô∏è
**CSCE 412 Cloud Computing Project 2** - Creating a Load Balancer

Learn how to model a simulation of a large company's load-balancing web requests using a load balancer.

This project will require a real-world implementation of a queue. Thsi will also need a struct, a lower-level data structure that allows data to be contained in an object.

Load balancers are available commercially, but in this project, you will build one that has:

‚óè **Requests** - generates random IP addresses, both in and out, and random times for each request to be processed.
+ IP in
+ IP out
+ Time (integer)	
  
‚óè **Webserver(s)** 
+ Takes requests from the Load Balancer
+ Process the requests
+ Asks for another
  
‚óè **Load Balancer**
+ Queue of requests
+ Keeps track of time.
